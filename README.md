# AppImageRadar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AppImage/AppImageRadar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AppImage/AppImageRadar)

Bash scripts to help quickly see what is going on in the AppImage world on GitHub:

* Which projects are using AppImage?
* Which projects mention AppImage but do not publish ones on GitHub Releases yet?
etc.

The output will be written to the Travis CI build log. This is mainly meant for internal consumption by the AppImage development team.
