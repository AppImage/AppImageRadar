# AppImageRadar

Bash scripts to help quickly see what is going on in the AppImage world on GitHub:

* Which projects are using AppImage?
* Which projects mention AppImage but do not publish ones on GitHub Releases yet?
etc.

This is mainly meant for internal consumption by the AppImage development team.
